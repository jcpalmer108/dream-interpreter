# Dream Interpreter
<strong>A Class-based React Demo App</strong>

I made this project over a weekend in order to demonstrate my understanding of class-based React. When I first entered the tech industry in 2016, class-based React was the only feasible way to enable state management within a component. Come 2018 however, functional React was introduced enabling a variety of new helper functions built into React to make functions less wordy and more streamlined. 

Personally, I prefer functional React due to its continued development and presence on high-end applications. I appreciate how I don't have to determine up front whether or not a componenent will need state, as I approach writing code with an agile and iterative mindset. I remember several times within my career where a stateless component suddenly needed state and I needed to rewrite a large component to go from a function to a class. With functional React, I don't have to go through this. 

Despite my preferences, class-based React is still the foundation of the knowledge I have pertaining to React. I'm familiar with all React lifecycle hooks, and have the added bonus of knowing how the useState and useEffect functions work. 

> NOTE: This application is still a WIP. When finished, this note will be removed and a live project spun up and demo link shared. 

## Special thanks to DreamMoods.com
`Dreammoods.com` was a website I loved to search through growing up. Interpreting my dreams became an entertaining way to pass my morning, as I usually identified with the results provided. 

This application specifically uses data from `Dreammoods.com`, however I've made their data more accessible and easier to use in my demo app. Given that I don't think that website has been updated in over ten years, I doubt we'll see a future iteration such as the one I've proposed but for the time being I'm content with using the app I've created to gather their data. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
